    "Searching for observations of moving targets can be challenging since their positions change across time and it is not always possible to tag each possible target on an observation's set of metadata. To that end, services like the JPL Horizons service exist to compute locations as a function of time for known moving targets. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use this service, alongside some custom functions, to perform queries for Kepler and K2 data in the MAST Archive."
